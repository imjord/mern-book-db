MERN book db

live link https://aqueous-tor-26449.herokuapp.com/ (heroku takes awhile to load).


first full stack MERN project by myself. Most of my full stack projects are used with ejs, so i decided to start small to practice doing a mern site. 


Isnt much just input a book title, author, and description and it will be put into the book db and displayed. you can also delete it.
